# ASIST_competency_analysis
Google Colab files needed to analyze Minecraft competency data and create a skill index for participants

Directions for use:
- Upload this folder onto your google drive
- Open .ipynb in google colab
- Place Competency test participant data (.metadata files) in the folder (e.g. c17 => competency test metadata for subject 17)
- Make sure the .xlsx file is saved as a google sheet
- Update the path to your Folder in the .ipynb (see notebook)
- Run each cell: the script will generate another tab in the google sheet with results (interpretation in notebook)
